							<h2 class="wow fadeIn article-subheader" data-wow-delay="1s">The founding of HTH UK.</h2>
							<p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1.5s">The charity had first started from several random acts of kindness, which had been influenced be the deficient experiences the founder had faced in the early stages of his life. With various different demotivating occurrences he had faced, the acts of kindness had naturally pushed him to get out of the stereotypes set on young teenagers, to become better and to help better others. Despite the negativity the founder faced, Adnan Davod founded the charity, Helping The Homeless UK (HTHUK), at the age of 16. Not only did the charity help those who were desperately in need, he helped this in similar predicaments as him by volunteering. By doing so, Adnan transitioned and had the fortitude of being supported by his amazing colleagues, Iqbal Tanay, Omar Butt, Nabhan Islam, Naveed Amiri, Daler Shira and Aaron Chen, who continuously took part in all charity events, input great ideas and were great people to work with. Later on in the year, Adnan gained a partnership with his local Asda, Wembley Park which helped him raise money and awareness for the charity. This gave HTHUK a source of funding when buying food and necessities for the homeless. </p>

							<h2 class="wow fadeIn article-subheader" data-wow-delay="1s">Making a Change UK.</h2>
							<p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1.5s">Still feeling contempt, Adnan took the charity a step further almost straight away by starting Making A Change UK, as he thought you shouldn't just help people, but make a change to their lives to help them in the long term run too. It also meant, Making A Change UK didn't have to just help homeless people, but everyone in need. Looking at area the volunteers lived in, there are various problems the people in their community face. So, the first step of Making A Change was by helping a single mum of 3 pay for 2 months of rent. This rapidly grew to helping struggling families by paying for grocery shopping, talking to the youth, organising mini football tournaments and much more. The group had been invited to various to events to spread the word of their movement, which then led up to when they contributed in funding the school "Unity Girls High School'. The school was on the verge of closing, when a supporter of the charity had messaged the team who came down to show their support and help them out...which relieved their fears the same night as a team, school and as a community and keeping the school running. </p>

							<span class="wow fadeIn caption" data-wow-delay="1.5s">Saved by the bell! (From Left to Right) - Omar Butt, a homeless person and Adnan Davod</span>

							<h2 class="wow fadeIn article-subheader" data-wow-delay="1s">Moving forward...</h2>
							<p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="1.5s">Now that was a long time ago. Since then, the charity constantly grew with more and more support from individuals and groups of people across UK and Europe. The charity also has wide spread support from mainstream artists, rappers and public figures which has helped the charity highly. With over 475 volunteers around different parts of London and cities in the UK, it is fair to say the charity has given the youth a second chance to fix their community. From volunteers doing self led work in their schools to raise money to those doing school projects on the charity. We hope the charity is a stepping stone to help everyone get everyone to where they want and we hope it motivates everyone to become a better, respectful and honest person. All volunteers have left with amazing life experiences, new friends and something to put down on their CV and personal statement. </p>

							<p class="wow fadeIn" data-wow-delay="2s">The HTHUK team (both charities combined commonly known as HTHUK) is a team of devoted individuals. The charity not only helps those in need, but helps themselves maintain the transition they are desperate to make, to become a good member of the community. This is evident in the attitudes they have towards life, the change in personalities, their confidence and their courtesy to those around them. All of our volunteers are incredible individuals going through a journey, and we hope HTHUK has been a part of their life journey. Many, if not all of the volunteers have amazing life experiences as well as stories which has helped our personal journeys. We welcome new volunteers with a warm welcome, a bag of necessities, quick summary of what to expect for the day and Adnan's funny yet unexpected mood swings. </p>
